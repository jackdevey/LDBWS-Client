# LDBWS-Client
A TypeScript client library for the [National Rail Live Departure Boards Web Service (LDBWS / OpenLDBWS)](http://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/openldbws/)

## What is LDBWS / OpenLDBWS?
As provided by National Rail:
> LDBWS provides a request-response web service to access real time train information from Darwin. This is the same information that powers the 
> Live Departure Boards, provided in XML format.

## Why this library?
LBDWS is a [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) based API which basically means it's kind of a big hastle to use! I created this library as I wanted a 
simple and updated way to interract with the service for my departure board CLI project called [Boards](https://github.com/jackdevey/Boards). All
other clients for the API seemed to be incredibly outdated or lacking of important features I wanted to use with Boards, so I had to develop my own method of
interracting with the service.

## How to use
To install LDBWS-Client from npm:
```
npm i ldbws-client
```
You will need an API key to use this library, you can apply for one from NRE [here](http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/)

To import the library in your code:
```javascript
import { LDBWSClient } from "ldbws-client";

// Create a new client instance
const api = new LDBWSClient("TOKEN");

// Get data from the API
await api.GetDepartureBoard("BHM", 10);
```

## Operations
Every operation on the LDBWS API is supported in the client, please refer to the LDBWS documentation [here](http://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/openldbws/)
